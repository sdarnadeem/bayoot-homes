Bayoot is a real estate web app based in UAE. It's built with the latest version of Nextjs and the data comes from Rapid Api. It simply displays the properties on rent and sale.

On every property there are details about the agency providing the property. You can contact the agent through the contact number or whatsapp link.

You can also filter the properties based on the number of rooms, facilities or location to get your desired property.
